## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### TODO

There is couple of things that could be consider when developing this project:

1. Seems there it's couple calculations that are depending one on another, using observables with redux-observables would make it more maintanable

2. Currently 2\*std is used as measure of confidence of measurement. Would be nice to experiment with that.

3. browsing different release - my assumption is those files would be stored on AWS (?) Perhaps would be nice to be able just to upload custom data through app.

4. definetely would be nice to get example of situations that needs to be detected and improve visualisations

5. There is good question what else is important for summary view. I wish have a bit more time and access to user to experiment with those
